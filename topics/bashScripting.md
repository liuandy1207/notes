## `bash` Shell Scripts
`bash` shell scripts are plain text files that contain a sequence of `bash` shell commands. <br>
When execute permissions are given, scripts can be exeucted through a direct path. <br>
Otherwise, scripts can be executed through `bash [FILENAME]`. <br>

By convention, these files end with `.sh`. <br>

```bash
/          # root directory
~          # home directory
~USERID    # USERID's home directory
.          # current directory
..         # parent directory

pwd               # print full path to the working directory
cd [DIRECTORY]    # change directory
```
