# C Abstract Data Types (ADTs)

## Data Structures vs. ADTs
With data structures, the client KNOWS THE STRUCTURE of the data and can DIRECTLY ACCESS the data. <br>

With ADTs, the client does NOT know the structure of the data and can only access data through the INTERFACE provided by the ADT. <br>

## Stack ADT
Stacks exhibit LIFO behaviour (last in, first out).

### Typical Operations
- **PUSH**
&emsp; → adds an item to the top of the stack
- **TOP**
&emsp; → returns the item at the top of the stack
- **POP**
&emsp; → removes the item at the top of the stack and returns it
- **EMPTY?**
&emsp; → determines if the stack is empty or not
