# C Primitives
C uses a **static typing** system where:
- All types **must be known** when the file **compiles**, and
- The type of an identifier **cannot change**. 

## Integers - `int`
32-bits of data are interpreted as integers. <br>
`int`s can have values between $-2,147,483,648$ and $2,147,483,647$. 

### Octal
`int` values that start with `0` are evaluated in octal. 

### Hexadecimal
`int` values that start with `0x` are evaluated in hexadecimal. 

## Bool - `bool`
32-bits of data interpreted as binary false (`0`) or true (any other value).
