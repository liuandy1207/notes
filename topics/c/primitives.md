# C Primitives
C uses a **STATIC TYPING** system where:
- All types **MUST BE KNOWN** when the file **COMPILES**, and
- The type of an identifier **CANNOT CHANGE**. 

## Integers - `int`
32-bits of data are interpreted as integers. <br>
`int`s can have values between $-2,147,483,648$ and $2,147,483,647$. 

### Octal
`int` values that start with `0` are evaluated in octal. 

### Hexadecimal
`int` values that start with `0x` are evaluated in hexadecimal. 

## Bool - `bool`
32-bits of data interpreted as **BINARY FALSE** (`0`) or **TRUE** (any other value).

## Characters - `char`
8-bits of data are interpreted as an ASCII character. <br>
Single quotes are used to indicate an ASCII character.
