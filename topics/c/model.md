# C Model of Computation

## Control Flow
At execution, the program location starts at the entry point (beginning of `main` function). <br>
As execution proceeds, the program location continues to be tracked. <br>

When a function is called, the program location jumps to the start of that function. <br>
When the keyword `return` is reached, the program locations returns back to the calling function. <br>
