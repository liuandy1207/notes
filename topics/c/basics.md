# C Basics

## Program Entry Points 
Programs are typically executed by an Operating System through a shell or another program. <br>
To do so, the OS needs to know where to start running the program. This is the **entry point**. <br>

In C, the entry point of a program is a special function called `main`. <br>
Every C program must have **exactly one** `main` function. <br>
By calling `main`, the OS transfers **control flow** to the program. After execution, it is returned to the OS.
