## Data Type - `int`
The size of `int` varies between machines and operating systems, but most systems use a 32-bit `int`. <br>
The range for `int` is $-2^{31}$ to $2^{31}-1$. Any values outside will result in **overflow**.

## Data Type - `char`
`char` can be used to store integers, but C only allocates 1 byte of storage for `char`s, so the range of values is $(-128, 127)$. <br>
`char` is rarely used for calculations. Instead it is often used to store ASCII characters (indicated by single quotes `'`). <br>
