# Efficiency
Algorithms are step-by-step descriptions of how to solve a "problem". <br>
We use efficiency to objectively compare algorithms.

## Types of Efficiency
- **TIME EFFICIENCY** <br>
&emsp; → how long it takes an algorithm to solve a problem
- **SPACE EFFICIENCY** <br> 
&emsp; → how much space (memory) an algorithm requires to solve a problem
- **POWER EFFICIENCY** <br>
&emsp; → how much power is consumed by the algorithm to solve a problem
