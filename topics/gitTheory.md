## Git
Git is a source code management system that uses distributed version control, which means that each user maintains their own repository. <br>
Thus, it is not required to have a master copy unlike other VCSs, however it is still quite common to have a single master repo.

### Core Concepts
1. **Repository (repo)** -> the canon version of your source code
2. **Working Directory** -> a copy of the repo, where you make changes before saving them in the repo
3. **Staging Area** -> a logical collection of changes from the working directory that you want to collect and work on together

## Local Repository vs. Remote Repository
**Local repositories** store personal projects.
**Remote repositories** are set up on a central server where multiple users can access them.

## Changeset
The changeset is a grouping of files that represent a change to the system.
